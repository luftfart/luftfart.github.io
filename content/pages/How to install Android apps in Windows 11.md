## Installations

  + **Check if your PC is compatible.** Not all Windows 11 PCs can run Android apps. To check if your PC is compatible, open the Settings app and go to **System > About**. Under “Specifications,” look for “Processor,” “RAM,” and “Virtualization.” Your PC must have a 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, and virtualization enabled in order to run Android apps.

  + **Enable virtualization.** If virtualization is not enabled on your PC, you will need to enable it before you can run Android apps. To enable virtualization, open the Start menu and search for “Turn Windows features on or off.” In the Turn Windows features on or off window, scroll down and look for “Virtualization.” Check the box next to “Virtualization” and click OK. Your PC will restart.
